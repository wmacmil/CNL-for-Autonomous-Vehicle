Touchdown is on the top of the flag pole. Face yourself so the black awning with light brown lettering will be on your right and the yellow building with swirly multi-colored painted top is to your left. Take the option on the right, then go straight down this road between these two buildings. When you get just about to the next corner there are construction cones and poles to your left. Stop when you are right in front of the second tree that's behind those cones on the left. Behind the tree is an orange cone that Touchdown is sitting on top of, next to a line of 5 gray trashcans under some very light yellow graffiti. Head towards the intersection next to the blue awning and make a left turn. You should notice a traffic light up ahead when you made the left turn. At the traffic light make another left turn. Follow the direction of the park vehicles passing the ladder on your left. Eventually you should notice a fence on your left head forward till you reach the end of the fence.

You'll see the first poster with a bottle on it, Touchdown is sitting on the top of the first bottle. Begin your journey by turning so that the potted plants are on your left and you are facing traffic.Walk a bit and turn left so you are between two brick buildings. When you get to the intersection, turn right so that you are again facing traffic. Walk past the building with the windows and beige awnings, which will be on your right. Turn left.

At the stop signs at the end of that block, go right again, and right once more at the end of that block. 

To your right should be a shop with a white sign band with huge green dimensional letters, and underneath that, a red awning.  Stop before the end of the block, just as you read the green awning of the right-hand corner shop.

Touchdown is atop it. Go against traffic, with the red umbrellas to your left, to the end of the block, and then left at the T-intersection. Walk just into the intersection [if you go too far, you'll find yourself teleported]. Ahead and to your left are two American flags angled off a building.  Touchdown is impaled at the end of the pole of the one closest to you. Turn with the flow of traffic and head to the nearest intersection.  Turn left and make a U-Turn.  Pass the government building on the right.  Go through the intersection.  Stop before of the stairs on the right.  There is a red circle hose hookup on the right side low by the plants.

Pass scaffolding and then Jersey walls on your right, and a red awning on your left.

STOP when you see two orange Jersey walls flanked by two white ones dead ahead of you, and a grey flag jutting horizontally almost directly above them (go one step further when you see the white bicycle symbol on the road, so that you have to rotate the camera down to see it just in front of you.)

Touchdown is affixed dead center to the dangling grey flag. Follow traffic, with the flag on your right.  Go left at the stop signs, where there'll now be red brick to your left and scaffolding to your right.

Go straight through the alley and out the other side, where you should be facing a large open garage door.  

Turn to your right, so that the garage is now on your left, and walk under the bridge.  Walk forward a bit further, and when you see a crosswalk on your left, try to angle to the left a little bit as you pass.  This will allow you to stay on the same road. If you do this correctly, a red/maroon awning with yellow lettering should stay on your left, and you should be able to keep moving forward.  If not, go straight backwards and try again.

There will be scaffolding on your right with a white banner and blue text draped across it and a red fire hydrant below it.
At the first intersection, make a u-turn by turning left and left again to go back down the same road you're on but in the opposite direction and still with traffic.
Head through the intersection ahead and you will see scaffolding on your right with a grey banner with green text draped across it.
At the next intersection, make another u-turn,
The building to your right will have a large black sign made up of the window panels with a large white logo and text on it.  At the next intersection, maneuver yourself until you are smack dab in the middle of the intersection and medians.  Directly in front of you are two black bells on the median.  Touchdown is hiding on the right bell. Turn so the nearby intersection is in front of you, and the shop with all the shirts in the window is on your left.  Go forward into the intersection and turn right.  
On this block, you'll have a building on your left that has a black wall with big red stripes. Go forward one short block to the next light, and turn right.
Now you'll have a park on your left and construction scaffolding on your right. Go forward until you're past the park and you have a big stone building on your left.  Along the wall of this stone building, you'll pass a set of gray double doors,  then you'll come to two cement planters.  The first one has a bush in it, the second one does not.  Stop when you've just passed the two planters.  Look back to the planter that's empty.  The bear is on top of it.

Go a little more than a block and stop when you are beside the big brown delivery truck parked on the left side of the street. Look to your right. Touchdown is sitting between the two words written in orange neon on the store sign. Orient yourself so that there is an intersection directly in front of you and scaffolding to your right.  Enter the intersection and turn right (the arrows might be a bit confusing, so make sure once you turn you see scaffolding on your right and a white storefront on your left.  Pass the two 3-way intersections.  Immediately after the 2nd 3-way intersection, you will enter a 4-way intersection. Turn left there.  There will be tan/off-white storefronts on your left.  Go straight through the first intersection.  There will be a building with huge white pillars on your left.  Pass these pillars.  You should then see a couple red doors on your left that are set into a building with a tan block first story.  Pass the first of these doors and stop.  Turn 90 degrees to your left.  The big pillars will now be in your view and you will be facing a big window with a rounded top.  This window is to the right of the huge pillars.  There is a keystone at the top of this window (a rectangular-ish stone at the very top of window's moulding).  Touchdown is sitting in front of this keystone.   Stand with the grass to your right, and move forward to the stoplight (passing straight through the 3-way turn). At the 4-way intersection, turn right, and you curve around until you're almost moving back in the opposite direction in which you started (but on a different street). Continue in this direction, passing a playground on your left. Then pass straight through an intersection, and on your left you will then pass a grassy area.  Continue straight rather than taking the road veering left. Then pass the brick wall to your right. Near the end of the brick wall, on your right is a small white and red sign on a street light pole. Touchdown is on that sign. Turn and move against the flow of traffic. At the first intersection take a left. Move down the block, at the next intersection take another left. Go down the block, watching the right side. After quite some ways you will see some scaffolding on the right, under a red overhang. Stop right in front of the beginning of the scaffolding. You will see a cutout on the overhang with a yellow street light in it. Touchdown is on top of the yellow street light.  Orient yourself so you are moving against the flow of traffic and heading towards a tunnel.
Head all the way through the tunnel and pass under the three red lights attached to the beam overhead.
A bit further and you should see the backs of two signs overhead.  Stop when you're under them.  Turn around and you will find Touchdown hiding on the middle green light on the beam ahead. Align yourself so you are with traffic. Walk to the four way intersection and take a left. Take a long walk forward to the next four way intersection. Take a left here. Continue forward and stop at the four way intersection. To your right are some potted plants. Touchdown is on top of the plant the farthest to the right.  You're going to want to go with the flow of traffic. You're going to follow this flow of traffic under the bridges until you start to see construction cones and yellow and black reflectors. You should see a blue sign in front of you, a greyish sign with blue lettering and a yellow sign with black lettering. Your touchdown will be the middle of the blue and greyish sign where the colors collide.  Orient yourself so that the fancy white building with a gold dome is in front of you.  Move forward such that you are following the street that curves around to the left.  You will curve around onto a major street where you will be facing oncoming traffic.  There will be trees surrounded by black metal fencing on your left.  Go straight through the first three-way intersection.  You will they come to another three-way intersection with an all-glass building up ahead of you.  At this intersection, stay to your right such that the all-glass building is on your left and you are still facing oncoming traffic.  Go straight through one intersection.  When you get to the second intersection, stop immediately after you cross over the first crosswalk.  Turn 90 degrees to your right and look down.  There is an orange cone sitting on the half-moon curb.  Touchdown is sitting on top of this cone.   Position yourself so the walking path is on your right and the bridge is ahead of you in the distance. You'll be walking alongside a park for a bit. Right before the park ends, you'll have the option to slightly merge left or right. Stay left, so you'll continue on this road rather than veer right when the service drive begins. 

Look for the brick building on your right that has two sections of rounded balconies with black wrought iron fences. In front of that building is a fire hydrant between two short poles. Touchdown is sitting on top of that fire hydrant.  Turn towards the intersection and turn left after going into it.  You will see scaffolding to the left above a long row of blue bikes.  Hang a left at the next intersection.  You will see an umbrella on the left that is yellow and red.  You should see scaffolding ahead on the left.  Just past the red awning on the left, turn left at the intersection.
Go the next intersection, stopping just shy of the scaffolding on the right.  You will see a round blue sign just in front of the scaffolding where Touchdown is hiding. Align yourself so that the building with blue trim is on your left, go straight to the next intersection and take a right.  Turn right onto the first street that you come to. It's a brick road and the window on your left has yellow writing. Take it to the next street and turn right.  You'll see lots of blue bikes to the left. Go down to the next intersection and you'll see a trash basket on your right.  Touchdown is hiding at the top of that trash basket. Orient yourself so you are going against the flow of traffic with the ornate arched structure in the distance ahead of you. Move forward going past the crosswalk just in front of you. Follow the road towards the archway. Soon you will meet another four way intersection. Go straight so that you are diverging left away from the archway. There should be a chicken Shop with a red awning in the distance to the left. Keep moving forward and soon you will come to a three-way intersection. Keep to the right And continue to move forward go straight past the four-way intersection. At this point you should have a median to the left of you with overgrown brush And a small stone wall on the right. Move forward between the stone wall and the median until you get to the next intersection. In order to go right here you will have to go forward until you meet a three-way intersection. Go backwards and to the left so that you are in the middle of the intersection (this part is tricky). Reorient yourself so that the building with the red awning is on your left and the construction is to your right. Continue forward down the crowded street. Go straight past the next intersection. And you should see several red paper lanterns hanging  above the road the road in front of you. Continue moving forward so that you were in the crosswalk at the next intersection. Turn to your left and you'll see a trash barrel in front of a light pole at the end of the crosswalk. Touchdown is sitting at the base of the trash barrel. Move down the street in the same direction as the traffic. At the intersection, turn left and continue past the busses parked on the right. At the intersection, turn left. Touchdown is on top of a planter to the left. Go with traffic flow and at the corner in front of you turn right. When you turn you will see a large red awning halfway down the street.

Go to the next corner and turn right. When you turn rental bikes will be on the right and scaffolding on the left. Go down this longer block until you see trashcans lined up in a row on the right side on the sidewalk, just after a black metal fence. Just before them is a red hydrant with a silver top. Touchdown is on top of the hydrant.  Turn so you are going the correct way down this road. At the intersection make a right turn. You will go under a pedestrian bridge. At the next intersection make another right turn. Once you are turned you will see the ramp/walkway leading up to the pedestrian bridge on your right. Go all the way down this long block. At the intersection make another right turn and go a very short distance forward then stop. On your left is a corner of a building with green awnings and on the right is a dirty faded red awning with some blue and yellow flags hanging from it. There is a trashcan at the right corner. Touchdown is on top of it. Stand so you are moving with the flow of traffic. Go forward a bit into the intersection and turn right. At the next intersection, turn right. Soon there's an option to veer right/back. Do so, and soon on your right is a green awning with a wooden pallet outside. Touchdown is on top of the pallet. Turn so the subway stop is on your right. Go straight. At the light take a left. At the next light take another left. There will be a store with a blue awning on your right. Go straight. At the light take a left. Stop a very short distance down the street stop before you get to the yellow cartoon character represented on the right side of the  road in front of a store. Touchdown is sitting on the head of this character.  Face the yellow school bus and go straight.  If you see blue benches on your right a ways down, keep going.  Keep going until you see the red (octagon shaped) signs ahead.  At this intersection, turn right.  You may need to get closer to the red car.  Move forward until you see the entrance to the building with the name and some art of people there.  Touchdown is in the flower pot on the left side of the entrance. Going with the flow of traffic, follow the road until the next intersection.  Turn left at the intersection.  At the next light, turn left.  As soon as you turn, there's a door inset in the red building on the left hand side.  Touchdown is setting in front of the door. Go with the flow of traffic such that there is an intersection just in front of you.  Enter this intersection and turn right.  You'll now be on a street with a row of trees on the left.  
Go to the next intersection and turn right again.  There will now be a red and white striped building on your right.  
Go down this street.  When you come to the first intersection (the one with the street that runs diagonally), go straight.  At the second intersection, cross over the first crosswalk but then stop immediately.  Turn to your left.  There is a black wire trash can on the sidewalk.  Touchdown is sitting on the sidewalk in front of this trashcan.   On your right you should see a building with a blue awning that stretches over the sidewalk. On the left is a building with a similar awning that is green. Head straight to the first intersection. Now make a right. Continue straight but do not go all the way to the intersection. You will see a building with a maroon colored awning beside a building with a green colored awning. Both buildings have white letters for their names. Touchdown is sitting on the maroon awning in between the two words. Rotate to face away from the nearest intersection.

Proceed to the next intersection
Turn right at this three way intersection

Proceed to the next intersection
Proceed forward through the intersection

Proceed to the next intersection
Turn left at the intersection.

Advance a short distance.
Stop.
Turn 180 degrees around and return to the intersection.

Proceed forward through the intersection again. This will be the same as though you had taken a right at the intersection when you initially approached it, but I apparently enjoy giving pointless directions.

Proceed a short distance forward, roughly a quarter of a block.
To your left, you will see a business with a bright yellow awning. Beyond, you will see a business with an orange awning.

Pass the yellow awning and approach the orange awning.
If you are aligned with the orange awning, you have gone slightly too far and should move back.

On the left side of the street, near the orange awning, notice a planter filled with flowers. The bear is sitting on top of the center green plant in the planter. Position yourself so the short carved cement wall is on your left and the red scaffolding is on your right. At that first intersection in front of you, turn right. The red scaffolding remains on your right and now there is green scaffolding on your left side. 

Move down this one-way street to the next traffic light, and turn right. Now, an orange and white construction barrier is on your left and a bus stop is just ahead on your right. Go straight through the next two intersections and slow down. Pass a building on your right with arched doorways. Look to your left, and you'll see a business with a red sign with white writing. There's a table in front of the windows of that business with a black and red banner on it. Touchdown is sitting right in the middle of that table.  Turn and walk in the direction of traffic, immediately coming upon an intersection. Go right.  There should be a building with an odd gun like shape on the roof ahead to your left. Before getting to it, go right at the next intersection. This is a small one way street with shops on the right that have green awnings. Walk ahead. You will pass by shops with construction on your right, keep going. On your left, notice the short brick walls with brown doors in them. Walk till you just get past the brick walls and stop.

Walk with the flow of cars to the intersection.  Turn right.  Walk to the next intersection.  Turn right.  There is usually someone who sells hats and scarves on this corner.  Walk forward one step.  Look across the street from this vendor.  Bear is on top of the fire hydrant.  Go with traffic on the one way. Turn right at the first intersection.  Turn right again at the next intersection. A hot dog stand will be on the corner. Look right for the white and yellow road barriers. Stop just pass the break in the barriers for the open garage There is a red pole to the left of the open garage with a cup on it. Touchdown is sitting where the cup is on top of the red pole. Rotate so that there is a business on your right with Red raised lettering above the door and you are facing the closest intersection, move into the intersection and turn Left onto a one way street.
There is now scaffolding to your left  and a brick building with green awnings to the right.
Continue  straight ahead down this long street to the traffic light passing a fenced in parking lot to the right along the way.
Travel through the traffic light and Stop in the center of the intersection.
To the left is a storefront with a green awning in front of which is a trash can next to the light post Touchdown is sitting atop the trash can
 Align yourself so that the two traffic signs are on your right, and head with the flow of traffic. Take a left at the intersection, then another left after.

Head in to the three way intersection ahead, and there should be three yellow poles in front of you. Touchdown is on the middle yellow pole. Turn so that the closed store is on your right. It has a red sign above it and is covered by metal, with a white sign with black and red lettering on it. Once that is on your right, continue down the street. You will pass a green shop on your right. Continue until you get to an intersection. Turn right at the intersection. You will see a large yellow grid on the building up to the left. Follow along this street until the intersection where the building with the yellow grid pattern is. Turn right. Follow this street until you see another intersection. Just before the intersection, there is a trash can with a green liner. Touchdown is at the base of the trashcan. Turn so you're walking with the flow of traffic. Go straight across the nearby intersection and continue until the next intersection, then turn right. Turn right at the next intersection and keep going straight until you arrive at a store with a blue awning on the right. Touchdown is sitting on top of that awning, in the middle above the door. Put the building with the red on your right.  Head straight.  Go through 2 intersections (Not counting the one you start in) and turn right at the 3rd.  Continue on this street, but stop before you enter the crosswalk of the next intersection.  Look left.  There are 2 silver poles.  The bear is on the left one.   You need to orient yourself so you are going with the flow of trffic. You will see a bunch of yellow cars on your right with construction stuff on the left. Keep forward as you follow the buses on your right until you hit the stoplight when they are behind your. You need to take a u turn and be on the other side of the right now. On your left you will be passing all the colorful buses. You should see a bunch of orange on your right because of construction on the building.  Go through the first stoplight and you should see dirt and construction on your right. To your right you should see two bright cones and and old worn out cone. Your touchdown will be the top of the worn out one.  Go in the same direction as traffic.  Move forward to the first intersection.  Turn right.  There will be a small park behind a fancy metal fence on the right.  Go through the first intersection.  After you go through it, you should see a light-green and off-white building to your left.  Pass all of the part of the building that is light green until you see only the bright yellow part of the building to your left. On your left is a metal bench.   Touchdown is sitting on this bench, in the middle seat.   From your staring position, turn around so that you can see three orange barrels and a bright yellow sign (with two black stick figures) on the left-hand sidewalk.  Go forward onto this road.  It will be a tricky first step, but make sure you can still see that bright yellow sign on your left.  If you can see the sign and a big red and white truck on your left, then keep walking forward.  It will be a long walk, so just go straight through the first intersection and then straight through the second intersection.  There should be a big gray-brick church on your left after the second intersection.  Now keep walking forward.  When you get into the middle of the next intersection, turn to your left.  You should see a man in a blue t-shirt on the sidewalk ahead and to your right, and a taxi with a red sign in front of you on your left.  Take a step forward onto this road and you should see a red SUV parked on the right side.  Ahead of you, on the right-hand sidewalk, you should see another bright yellow sign with stick figures.  Walk forward toward it, and you should soon see Touchdown the Bear on top of that sign.  You'll need to be close to the sign to see him, but don't go past the sign. Align yourself with the bridge pillars on your left and the apartment buildings on your right. Head up to the next intersection to take a left, and then shortly after passing under the bridge, make another left. Head halfway down this street until your only choice is to go back or make a left. In front of you behind the car is two white trash bags. Touchdown is sitting on top of the closer trash bag. Position yourself so you're moving with the flow of traffic. Go straight through the first intersection. When you get to the second intersection, turn left. After  you turn, there will be a long business on your right with several dark awnings. When you get to the next intersection, turn left again. You should see a bus stop just up ahead on your right. 

At the next intersection, go straight through, but stop as soon as you get to the crosswalk. There's a white building on your left with dark trim around the windows. Look closer at the corner, and you'll see a green trash can next to a traffic light pole. Touchdown is sitting on top of that trash can on your left.  Turn so the apartment building with the big lawn is on your left. There is a traffic light just in front of you. Move forward and make a right at this three-way intersection, which will put you in a four-way intersection (sort of).  When you're in this four-way-choice spot, turn so the little building that has a green awning will be on your right as you leave the intersection.  Go in that direction, passing the green awning on your right.  
At the next intersection you come to, turn right.  You'll be on a very narrow street with red bricks on the right and light-colored stone on the left.  Go forward to the intersection ahead of you.  You'll have the option of making a hard left or a less extreme left.  You wan the less extreme left (it will take some effort).  You want to be in the lane where you're passing the brick apartment buildings on your right and you'll pass the store with the blue awning on your left.  Just past the store with the blue awning you'll reach another intersection (three way).  Go straight.  
You'll come to a y-split in the road.  Stay to the right to stay on the main, wider street.  Ignore the option to turn left and continue straight toward the traffic light.  Just after ignoring that left turn, look on the right side.  There are several newspaper dispenser boxes that are orange, red, and yellow.  Stop before you're even with them.  The bear is on top of the red box. Turn so that the buildings are on your right and the park is on your left. At the first intersection make a right. Go through the uneven intersection where the road forks, staying to the right to go straight through it. At the next intersection right after that, make a right. There will be a row of parked cars backed into parking spaces on the left. Behind the cars on the left are buildings with green awnings. Touchdown is under the middle awning, sitting at the top of the stairs right in front of the doors.  Orient yourself so that you are facing a street that has angled parking on the right and parallel parking on the left.  The cars in the angled parking have all backed in to their spots.  Go straight; turn right at the first intersection.  There will now be green bike lanes on your left and angled parking again on your right.  Head down this street.  When you get to the intersection, turn left, stopping immediately after you exit the intersection/cross over the crosswalk.

Once you get past those on the left you'll see large doors to the left and a parked white truck is inside one of those. Go a little further. Right before you get next to the blue doors with blue fencing on the left side come to a stop. You will not be next to them yet. At the restaurant that is right before those line yourself up with the yellow striping on the ground in front of that restaurant. Touchdown is on the outer corner of the yellow. Move with the flow of traffic, past the tall brick building on your left followed by sports courts, until the first intersection. At the intersection, turn right.

Touchdown is on the cross (sorry if this offends you). Orient yourself so that the corner with fencing and barbed wire is on your left. Proceed forward. Stop just before the building with tall red doors on the right. Touchdown is on the top of the flag extending from this building. Follow traffic into the intersection and go left. Go to the end of the block and make another left.  Continue down the one way street, where you will pass on your right a very bright neon green overhang and window dividers painted bright yellow and then a row of white Jersey barriers that ends in two orange ones.  Walk slightly past that and rotate around, so you're looking at the last orange one straight on. This is an important step. Don't stop too soon.

You should see an orange plastic pole shape thing, which is the only one of its kind anywhere here, on top of the orange Jersey barrier at the end. Touchdown is on top of that.  Follow traffic, with the park with the courts behind the black fence to your right, and go right at the light. Go through the next one, and stop just before you reach the end of the building with the bricks painted blue and adorned with flowers and butterflies, and before drawing even with the hydrant ahead and on your right.  
Touchdown is atop the white cap of that black hydrant. Go with traffic flow all the way down to the first intersection you come to and turn right. 

Go down through the next intersection, but not too far through. 

There will be a bright blue awning on the right with white lettering.

Look for the steps leading into the building. Beyond the steps are gray double doors. Touchdown is sitting on the ground in the center of the two doors.  If you look around there should be a beige building on your right and a green awning. You want to head in the same direction as the the red building with a staircase and a green awning if you check your surrounding. Make a left turn at the intersection when you arrive. Follow the road until you reach another intersection. At this intersection make a left turn. You should be in an alley. If you go up a few steps there should be a bicycle leaning on a tree. There should be a white car next to the bike. Up ahead at least one step is a silver car and a light green car. The tocuhdown is on top of the trash can  From your starting point, turn around so that you see a large poster advertising a smartphone up ahead of you, and two American flags hanging from the building on your left.  Walk forward, and go straight through the first intersection that you come to.  Just make sure that the smartphone billboard is always in front of you, and on the left side of the road.  Keep walking, and you will pass the billboard.  

Stop when you get into the middle of the next intersection.  Step forward, through the intersection, and then, without turning around, take a step back, and to your right.  Again, without turning, you should now be looking directly at some scaffolding and a green wall.  Now you can turn around so that the green wall is on your left, and you see a lot of black and white garbage bags piled up on the left-hand sidewalk up ahead.  If you turn to look to your right, you should see a gray metal food cart with a purple electronic sign.  Turn back to look down the street (toward the trash bags) and walk forward.  If you see a small alley on the right with a dark SUV parked in it, you are on the right track, so you can just keep going straight.  

You will eventually come to an intersection, and see an orange chimney behind a mesh fence in the middle of the road.  Walk forward toward that chimney, and stop when you are right next to it.  You can now turn to your right, so that you are looking down a street with storefronts with black-bordered windows on both sides.  Walk down this street.  You will soon see some scaffolding and a green canopy on the sidewalk to your right.  

Walk forward, into the intersection, and move forward towards a store with large glass windows and a sign with one bright green letter.  Step through the intersection so that this store is on your left.   

There will be a bus stop on the right-hand side of this street.  Touchdown the Bear is sitting on the middle of the bench, under the canopy of this bus stop.

Follow the traffic on the right lane, passing the brick buildings, and make a left at the first intersection. You will now have scaffolding on your right. Continue past it, passing the lime green awning on your right, along with the yellow store front and stop when you reach the green construction wall on your right. Look right, on that green wall there is what looks like a small, diamond window. Touchdown is on the center of that diamond. Orient yourself with traffic and proceed. Turn right at the first light. Turn right at the next light too. Stop when you reach the point you are in the single lane that is open. There is a yellow piece of machinery on the sidewalk to your right and Touchdown is in its seat. Turn and go with the direction of traffic on the street you are on. There is a dining area to your left with red awnings over it.  You will see a bridge overhead in the distance ahead of you as you begin down the street. Just before going completely under that bridge, you will go down the street on your right. The bridge should now be to your left. Go ahead, up a small incline. At the top, go straight through the next intersection. There will be a sidewalk on your right, and a short iron fence along your left. At the next intersection, go right. There is usually a hot dog vender on the corner to your left just as you turn on the street. A few doors down on your left, notice a driveway that lets you drive underneath the buildings on your left. Go just past that turn to look at the other side of the street, the right side. You should be in front of another opening for cars underneath the building, it looks like a garage. There are 2 yellow posts, one on each side of the garage. Touchdown is sitting right on top of the yellow post to the right.  turn to flow with traffic and  turn left at the 1st light. there is a brick church with a round window on your right.

 From your starting point, turn around so that you are facing the middle of a large intersection, and there is a red brick building on the right.  

Walk forward, so that this red-brick building stays on your right.  As soon as you pass the building, there will be a large playground on your right, behind a vertical black fence.  You are on the right track, so go straight forward, but sidestep to your right when you come to a fork in the road, and then keep moving forward (it will be just past a bright yellow sign with black stick figures on your right).  

You should now pass a building with bright red doors on your right.  Keep moving forward, and your street will merge with another, and you will start moving to your right.  

Just move forward with the road.  A green awning with large white letters should stay on your left, and you should see another bright yellow sign up ahead on your right.  

Move forward, past the parked trucks and the blue canopy over the right-hand sidewalk, and walk straight over a pair of crosswalks.  After the crosswalks, there is a shop of your right with blue walls and a blue awning with yellow and white lettering.  Walk just past this shop, and turn right as soon as you are able.  You should see an orange and white chimney in the middle of the street.  

Take a step toward that chimney, and it will probably disappear from view.  Just turn to your right and look back at that blue shop.  In the middle of the awning is a yellow rectangle.  Touchdown is sitting on top of that rectangle, right in the middle. Enter the intersection and look for the corner store with red signs and white letters, also has pictures of hamburgers in the windows. Go down the street to the left of it. At the next intersection you will see a light colored building ahead on the right with a green dome on the roof. Go to middle of this intersection and stop.

You'll see red banners hanging from the building on your right.  When you reach the first intersection, turn left.  Go past the large rack of blue bicycles on your left.  You'll pass over a large speed bump; at this point there will be a large building on your right with concrete and few windows at the ground level and brickwork above.  When you are just past the main entrance to this building, mostly closed off by metalwork, look to your right.  Just to the entrance's left is a faded yellow and white sign: radioactive Touchdown is on this sign. Following the traffic, go to the direction where you see a police car and yellow cab. Stop at the next intersection. You should see a store with blue letter sign on the left and a store with red letter sign on your right. Heading to the intersection and turn right, if you did this right you will see a brown delivery truck on your left and a bus on your right. Follow the traffic to the next intersection, go to the center of the intersection and you will see a shop around the corner with red banner and a sign that has three triangles as the background. The touchdown is on the middle triangle.  turn yourself until you can see a red canopy over a window to your right. Follow that street until you reach the 4 way intersection. To your right there is a trash can in front of a sign pole, touchdown is at the base of the trash can  Follow traffic to the light and go right.  Go right again at the next one.  Go right again at the one after that.  

Stop when the white building is to your right and you can rotate right and be looking directly at its door. Touchdown is atop the grey parking meter. Orient yourself so that the playground is to your left. Move straight for awhile; you'll pass through one intersection. At the next intersection, turn right--BUT don't use the turn farthest right. You need to move left a bit first, so that after the right turn you are on the left side of the road.

 You'll pass a blue dumpster on your right. Then on your left, you'll see a tall roll of orange netting. Touchdown is on the orange netting. Follow traffic through the light you immediately find yourself at, and ignore all the right hand turns, going to the light where you can go left and doing so.  There'll be green construction barricades on both sides and a glass building off in the distance.

Watch on the right, and stop just after you pass the very large heap of rocks behind the orange fencing on that side.  Rotate right.

You should see a small red sign with white text on the pole holding a traffic info sign. Touchdown is adhered to its center. If you're in the right position you're in the intersection and on your right you see a white sign with a black arrow. On your left you'll see a black fence across the street with lots of trees behind it. Also on the left there is a larger fence which appears to be covering a ball field of some sort.
Once you are in position head straight. If you are heading straight you are now running parallel with the ball field to your left. You will eventually go under what appears to be a wooden and green metal bridge with brick pillars.
You will still continue straight.
Eventually you will see what appears to be a soccer field with a large black fence surrounding it on your right.
You will want to just barely passed the soccer field and you will look at the barrier that is made of concrete on your right.

Go through the stop signs where the road goes left. Don't turn here.
At the next intersection, don't turn at the first chance, but go a bit further ahead then turn left so you are in the correct lane.
Just as you begin on this road, there will be a bus stop on the right. Touchdown is on the left side sitting on the bench.

 Orient yourself in which there is some black trash can on your right and a red building on your left. Once you pass those you should come across a T intersection in which you should make a right turn. After you made a right turn, continue forward passing all the orange barrels on your right and eventually you will come across a T intersection. Make a left at this intersection, Once you make a left pass all the cars parked on the left hand side. and blue scaffolding. Once you pass the scaffolding you should come across another intersection in which you should make a left turn.

There is a gray square pole with a blue stripe around the top in front of the scaffolding. Touchdown is on top of that gray square pole. Turn so the construction equipment and orange cones are at your back.  Walk forward (you'll pass through an intersection right away, because you basically started at an intersection).  At the next intersection after that initial one, turn right. When you've almost reached the next intersection,  keep your eye on the buildings on your left.  One of them looks like a painted garage door with a big skull and cross-bones on it.  The bear is sitting on top of the skull. Get all the way into the intersection then make a left. There will be a theatre just ahead on the right. Go one block then make a right turn. Once you turn there are posters on the wall on the left. Go down this block and make another right turn. There are thin red awnings all the way down the left side. Go a short distance. On the right side there are bikes locked up  before and after a grey pole with a blue stripe.

Stand so that you are walking with the flow of traffic with one black van. Move forward (passing a blue tarp in the street on your right), through one intersection, and walk until you reach a store with a yellow sign on your right, just before a blue and white store sign. Touchdown is on the white star on the blue and white sign. Rotate to follow traffic down the small one way street with the row of blue bicycles parked to your right, and proceed until you reach the intersection.  Go left, and proceed through the next intersection.

 Look around and you should be near a traffic light head and head towards it and make a left turn. Keep on heading toward straight passing the scaffolding on your left in which you should arrive at an intersection but don't make any turns and continue heading straight. Along the way you should notice a traffic light at the end. Once you arrive close to the traffic light you should notice some black trash bags on your left. To the right of the trash bag is a brown box with foreign asian characters. The touchdown is sitting on top of the brown box. You're going to want to go with the flow of traffic towards the bridge. And take a right at that intersection. Then take another right at the next intersection. You should see an old blue car on the left and a newer beige one on the right.

Follow the flow of traffic and then turn left at the intersection. When possible, make a U-turn and go straight. You will see a grassy area on your left. The touchdown is a red fire hydrant that says "36" on it. It is right on the "36". Orient yourself so you are facing the same way as the traffic and looking at the closest intersection.  Walk forward into the intersection and turn right.  Walk down this long road until you are right at the beginning of the overpass, and can turn right.  Take that right turn and head down this road.  Go straight at the intersection where the overpass traffic merges with the road you're on.  At the next intersection, turn right.  There is a large green wall to your right as soon as you turn.  It has a black sign that has white and orange letters.  The sign also has an orange circle with a black arrow on it.  Touchdown is in the center of that orange circle.

Touchdown is on the birdlike logo on the awning. Follow traffic, and go left at the fourth light.  The building on your left will have greyish awnings with white stripes.  Stop when you pass the first roll-up metal door on your right, and can rotate right, and be staring head on at a black door.  

Touchdown is adhered to the yellow sticker with black letters on the black door between the two metal roll-up doors. Turn so the grassy area is to your right. You need to go right at the upcoming intersection. There should be a building with blue windows on the second floor to your left. After that, you will pass a playground with green and yellow structures on your left. At the next intersection, go right, but not into the first lane you come to.

To the left of the door, on the green wall, is a white surveillance camera. Touchdown is atop it. Turn so you'll be moving in the same direction as the traffic on this one way street (not which way the parked cars are all facing).  Go forward to the end of this block.  Stop just before you enter the intersection (so you're standing in the crosswalk, but haven't gone out into the intersection).  The store to your right, on the corner, has a white and orange bench outside it.  The bear is on the part of the bench closest to you (sitting on the bench). Turn so you are facing the flow of traffic and you will see a painted word on the street right in front of you. Go straight. When you come to the intersection, turn left. Go straight down this one way street until you reach an intersection. Turn left. Go straight down this one way street, seeing a street light up ahead.

Touchdown is sitting in the middle of this sign.  Turn so that you're walking in the same direction that the cars are driving. Go straight until the next intersection, then turn right. Turn right again at the next intersection and go down the street until you have what looks like a chapel on your left. Touchdown is sitting on the door knob of the door to the chapel. Get turned so the bright blue benches are on your left side and you are facing the intersection. Go straight. Turn right and go across to the other lane then turn right again so you are going back on the same road but on the other side of it. When you come to the first intersection that is on a curve keep going straight on this road. There is some orange construction equipment on your left side. At the next intersection where the road still curved to get there, make a right turn. Once you get turned you should see a white building up to your left ahead that has a parking lot before it. You will pass a playground on your right side. Right after you get past the playground come to a stop. If you look right you will see a walkway between the playground fence and the building that has blue under and over the windows. There is a fire hydrant just to the left of the walkway that has 2 yellow poles by it. Touchdown is on top of that hydrant.  Follow traffic to the end of the block with the scaffolding on your left and the fenced in park to your right. Go left. At the end of the block, go left again. You should be on a street with a strip of red asphalt and trees along the sidewalk on your right.

Walk until the building with the stoop with blue railing is directly to your right, and turn to the left. You should be facing a dark grey building with a large glass window and smaller glass door, flanked on the left by a shop with a blue sign band with white text, and on the right with a white sign band with red text.  You should see a black door with 12 small panes of glass. Above it are two lights, between which are two circles, one red and one yellow.

Touchdown is impaled on the red circle. Align yourself so all the taxis are on your right, and head straight through the first intersection, to make a right at the second intersection. You should pass a neon red lettered sign on your right after the turn. A couple steps down after the scaffolding ends on your left, you'll see a black shuttered door with a black sign above it, behind a white service van. Touchdown is in the middle of the black sign. Make sure you are facing in the direction of traffic, with the scaffolding to your left. Walk down the street, passing the construction on your right. You will also see a store with tall windows and yellow curtains on your right, and directly after it there will be an intersection, at which you will turn right. Pass the scaffolding on your right, and cross the intersection right after it. Stop when the hot dog stand is just to your right, and you can see an American flag on your left. Touchdown is sitting on top of the trash can next to the hot dog stand.  Face to follow traffic and go right when you reach an intersection. Go right again at the next one.

You should see on your right a very red building with many shops. Walk past that, and look on your left and ahead, for a red overhang. (don't go to it). When you can see it diagonal to you, look to your right.  There is a shop with two pillars with smooth bases and huge bricks.

On the last pillar is a small circular metal plaque, on the smooth part right under the bricks. The touchdown is stuck to it. When you are going in the right direction, an intersection will be right there. Go right at that intersection directly in front of you. Go down this road with traffic cones on your left. Go through the first intersection and turn right at the second. Moving with traffic, go down this road a ways, past a blue round canopy on the left, to where you see green bushes on the left, just past the blue fire escapes on the right. Past a red round canopy on the left, past the first red door on the left, there is a second, lighter red door that Touchdown is placed below the knob. With the red stripe on your right, go to the light and GO LEFT. GO LEFT at the THIRD light, STOP before passing the markings on the asphalt, before the crosswalk.  You should see a fenced in court on the left corner and a fenced in playground on the right corner as you're looking down the street.

FIND Touchdown center on the yellow triangular sign ahead and to your right. Go with traffic coming at you down the one way. Go straight at the right turn only.
Turn left at the intersection. Traffic will still be coming at you. Stop just pass the word school painted on the street before the next intersection. There is a red and gray fire hydrant between two gray poles on the left. Touchdown is sitting on top of the fire hydrant.  
 Follow the flow of traffic with the scaffolding on your left and make a left at the first intersection. Pass the red awning on your left and make your last left at the first intersection. Continue past the green awning on your left and stop when you have a red awning on your left and blue awning on your right.

Go straight until there is a trash can and cigarette ash can along the wall of the building on the right side of the road. Touchdown is between the two cans against the wall.  Stand so that you are walking with the flow of traffic and moving away from the close intersection. Continue straight, passing one intersection. Continue until you are between 2 basketball courts. On your left is an orange sign outside the court. Touchdown is the center of the orange sign. Turn so you can follow traffic to the intersection that is a very short distance away.  Go to that intersection and turn right.   You'll see a billboard with a lime green stripe near the bottom.  Follow this one-way road through two intersections and turn right at the third when you see the bright yellow building on the left. With the yellow building behind you, continue down this road following the brick wall on your right.   Stop right before the brick wall turns into a metal wall.  There is a single red sign on a post in front of the brick wall.  Touchdown is sitting in the very middle of the red sign. Turn and go in the same direction as traffic. Go left at the intersection, then turn yourself around and go back to the intersection.  You should have a blue and white striped awning on the corner store to your right. Go straight through this intersection. Go right at the next intersection. The corner store to your right will have big yellow and red letters. Stop just after passing those letters. Looking at the corner store to your left, note the circle item in the window. Touchdown is in the middle of that circle.  Orient yourself so that the intersection is directly in front of you.  There will be a park to your left.  We are walking around the block such that this park will always stay on your left.  Go straight through the intersection directly in front of you, straight through the 3-way intersection you encounter, then turn left at the 40way intersection.  As you head down this road, go straight through the first 3-way intersection, but stop at the second one.  Stop immediately after you cross over the first crosswalk.  To your left is a black and white sign with an arrow that is pointing in the direction you were heading.  Touchdown is on top of this sign, in the middle of the top.   Orient yourself so that the bright store with gold writing is to your right, and on your left is a gray store with blue details and white letters. Move straight until you come to a 4 way intersection and pass straight through it. You should pass some plants on your left. Continue straight through an option to veer left, then straight through an opportunity to veer sharply right. 

When you come to the next intersection (with a blue store border to your left), you need to go straight to enter into it, then you'll have the chance to move in 4 directions; stop here. Ahead of you to the right is an orange cone next to a pole. Touchdown is on top of the cone. Go into the intersection and turn right. If you are headed the correct direction the road is straight and does not curve.There is a building on the right side that juts out in a geometric angled type of design. Go straight. At the first intersection, turn right. Once you are turned there is a building with angled support beams or columns to your left. Go forward just a short distance until you are almost to the corner of that building. Across the street on the right side there is a building with a lot of yellow. Touchdown is sitting on the ground  at the ATM that is in front of that store. Turn so you'll be walking with the flow of traffic on this one-way street. Go straight until you come to an intersection, and turn left at the intersection. Go one very short block to the next intersection and turn left. You'll have construction scaffolding on your right as you start down this block.  After the scaffolding you'll pass a very blank-looking wall on the right, then a boring brick building.  After the boring building you'll come to a brighter building on the right (white walls and colorful accent painting).  Stop just before you're in line with the green overhang over the front doors of that colorful building - you'll be even with two navy blue sets of doors.  One set of navy blue doors has two door handles (one on each door).  The other set of navy blue doors has just one handle (the left set of doors).  The bear is on that single door handle. Follow traffic across the intersection down the one way street, where there is a white brick building that has colorful graffiti of a cityscape on it to your left.

Face this building dead on, so its black door is slightly to your left and the purple bridge painted on its wall a little to your right. You should be facing a white skull painted on a grey metal security door.  

Touchdown is attached directly between the eyes of the skull. Turn so the tree is on your left and go with traffic flow to the first corner you come to and turn right.

Still with traffic flow, go to the next corner, turn left, then stop. Turn around and now go down this road as you cannot turn right at the corner to get down this road. As you begin down the road, on your left is a red brick building with the store name multiple times down the side of the building. Above the store name are triangle shaped windows. Go down this road going through the immediate intersection option as that's the road you just came off of.

Go through the next 3-way intersection that comes up and stop just before the food cart that's on the right just a short bit ahead. Before the food cart is a square gray post with a blue line around the top. Touchdown is on top of that square gray post with the blue line around the top.
