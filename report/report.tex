\section{Abstract} 

We introduce a grammar for a controlled natural language (CNL) to give
imperative commands for an envisioned voice assistant route-planner for a
self-driving vehicle. The utility of the CNL is that it is inductively defined
by a grammar : thereby, the sentences it admits, parsed as Abstract Syntax Trees
(ASTs), can be manipulated as mathematical objects amenable to verification
techniques. Using the TOUCHDOWN data set to empirically motivate common idioms
and phrases our grammar should be capable of parsing, we give a denotational
semantics from our ASTs to a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, essentially
expressing sequences of states which are amenable as specifications to
downstream applications whose goal is the verification of various aspects of a
vehicles behavior. This work contributes to a large existing literature,
connecting the somewhat disparate research spaces including CNLs, verification
for natural language-controlled robots, and semantic parsing.

\section{Contributions}

Initially motivated to give the system assurances against so-called
substitution-based attacks, whereby impose ``meaning equivalence'' for synonymic
expressions by imposing posterior conditions on the parse trees. Clustering via
the tree structure to provide some the equivalence to meaningfully similar
sentences was an initially enticing direction, as had been done with
Komendantskaya and Heras' work on Machine Learning for Proof General (ML4PG)
\cite{ml4pg}. However, this work had the advantage that there are multiple
large, well-maintained Coq libraries which were amenable to clustering.
Successful clustering results could give rise to proof developers seeking
suggestions in their developments.

Our use case, the design of a non-existent language, left us with the conundrum
of an impoverished data set to train over. There was no empirical data source
from which to observe ``natural ASTs'', and generating trees in an ad-hoc random basis would
not likely provide real-world applicability. What has followed should be seen as
a response to these constraints. Our intention was to find a data set suitable
to give examples of non-trivial natural language utterances, in addition to
finding a suitable semantic language with utility and applicability which is
amenable to translation from sentences parsed by our grammar. Working from both
the empirical and semantic directions seemed the most reasonable way to build a
robust least prototype of a CNL .

The primary contributions of this undertaking so far are as follows :

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item A Grammatical Framework (GF) grammar providing the definition of a CNL for
suitable directives from a passenger to a driving agent
\item A Haskell library mapping trees generated by our grammar a particularly well-behaved subset of LTL
\item An Agda implementation of LTL with a standard semantic interpretation
\item A refinement of the TOUCHDOWN dataset \cite{chen2019touchdown} suited to our needs of designing a
better grammar
\end{itemize}

We suggest that while each of these components are still relatively primitive,
they define a pipeline which has potential to provide both theoretical insights
to researchers and suggest possible practical steps that can be taken to
constructing robust voice applications in industrial settings. In addition to
discussing our own contributions, we give a relevant and comprehensive literature
review that embeds our work in the context of ongoing studies about these
topics.

This work should be seen as a stepping stone, specifically we view it as :

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item A survey of existing literature about this problem 
\item A preliminary work attempting to fit in pieces of a solution to the problem  
\item A framework and prescription for how to fit this preliminary work carried
  out here with existing work from elsewhere in attempt to build a comprehensive solution
\end{itemize}

The feasibility of a realistic solution will doubtless rely on the future work
of many collaborators and years of research, engineering, and testing. It is
therefore naive to assume that many of the questions posed below are answerable.

\section{Overview}

Perhaps the most pervasive question in the use and application of natural
language technologies can be stated as follows : How does one optimize the
system to provide for wide coverage of the domain while ensuring that system is
robust? This question exemplifies the boundary of the verification-minded
``formalist'' and data-oriented ``empiricist'' camps in designing such
technologies.

The statistical and machine learning methods applied to Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks have produced impressive results over the past three decades.
They take a more pragmatic approach : compromise robustness for wide coverage,
as this means the tools will be usable and by non-experts. The belief espoused
is that the machines should ``learn'' from (and possibly like) us. Somewhat orthogonal techniques
prioritize the formal approaches of the computational linguistics communities.
These methodologies are often more concerned with theoretical justification and
explainability.

While practical tools are a goal, building practical applications often isn't
linguistically informative and therefore the empiricists' goals shouldn't
override work on building the theoretical models which enable our understanding
of the machines. Those in the formalist camp, prioritizing theoretically
informed systems, seek predictable and well-defined behavior for specific
problem domains. Yet, these systems fail to generalize without an explosion in
complexity when presented with data outside their domain.

Natural language is difficult because it is both structured with respect to
``rules'', perhaps more descriptively titled \emph{logical behaviors} which
admit lots of predictability. Yet natural language continuously breaks or
introduces exceptions to these rules, necessitating empirical and observational
understanding. This makes it exceedingly hard to penetrate with exclusively the
empirical or formalist approach. Many are led to wonder about the degree to
which large amounts of linguistic data can be augmented with theoretical
linguistic knowledge to create optimal and practical systems with respect to
both breadth and depth of coverage of language phenomena. The ultimate question
seeking compromise from both camps asks : how can we build machines which
``understand'' us (or at least our data), and which are comprehensible by us.

This problem acutely arises when trying to design a voice assistant in the
domain of commanding controllable robots, specifically, autonomous vehicles. For
the actions a vehicle takes, the motion and path decisions, must be formally
specified and controlled via some computer system subject to mathematical
formalism. Assuming the user directing the vehicle isn't aware of these
formalisms, it is incredibly difficult to design a verifiable controller capable
of dealing with the breadth of language one may encounter in the wild.

The instructions an arbitrary user gives are not subject to the same formalities
the system requires. For her commands may leave out necessary detail (``go into
the other lane'' with multiple lanes on either side), say something wrong with
respect to reality (``go into the other lane'' on a single lane road), or give a
command the driver should recognize as possible but bad (``drive directly
into the car ahead''). Additionally, the driver may need to recognize many
ways many users may say ``the same thing'', that is the same with respect to
some semantic formalism. In a dual sense, the same utterance may admit two
perfectly meaningful interpretations in two situations or contexts. The phrase
``drive to the store with the dog'' should account for whether the dog is inside
of the car. It is obviously worrisome that a nefarious actor may somehow
interfere with the controls at any stage by exploiting these manifold issues,
and indeed many more. A failure to adequately deal with these circumstances in the
vast majority of cases is not reassuring if one believes many verifiability
criteria are critical for such technologies to see adoption.

We therefore analyze our ``big-picture question'' above in the following
``sub-question'' : how can one map the manifold ways of presenting information
to an autonomous robot into a rigorous and formally verifiable kernel which the
controller can understand? Our proposed solution is to build a semantic parser
from natural language commands to linear temporal logic, whereby we can filter
the many empirical natural language commands into a ``canonical subset'' defined
by our CNL which are equivalent to (sets of) temporal logic formulas. We detail
here both the progress to these ends, as well as the challenges.

\section{Previous Work} 

This research broaches many different fields, many of which were
unknown to the author prior to this work. Indeed, voice assistants may
encompass almost any natural language processing task, and autonomous vehicles are
seen as one a premier emerging robotics technology (and certainly the most talked
about in the popular zeitgeist).

Limiting the scope of work in this context can be challenging, as so many
different tools and ideas can be seen as relevant. We therefore try to very
explicitly narrow our focus to investigate how feasible it is to build a
language for an autonomous vehicle that exhibits predictable behavior and also
satisfies verification properties - this includes a determination to what extent
the properties can even be stated. As the full development of such as a system
is a grandiose vision, we hope to highlight many of the difficulties already
arising, and also those one may anticipate.

The approach taken sets out to build a semantic parser, which, despite its
primitivity, serves as a Petri dish through which many of the deeper questions
in this space may be viewed.

\subsection{GF, Parsers, and Personal Work}

The questions of designing an idealized and expressive formal language, with
roots in Frege \cite{frege79}, manifested more recently in the natural language
semantic tradition of Montague \cite{Montague1973}, who proposed an
interpretation of English in a typed higher order logic with a focus on
quantifiers. Aarne Ranta, a student of Martin-Löf, attempted to reformulate
Montague's work in an intuitionistic setting \cite{ranta1994type}, thereby
amenable to a natural treatment via computer programs \cite{ml79}. In
implementing a parser from natural language to a dependent type theory, Ranta
discovered that the dual sugaring (pretty printing) transformation of a tree to
a string could allow for a general mechanism of purely syntax-based translation.
This work culminated in Grammatical Framework (GF) \cite{ranta_2004}.

Grammatical Framework became a full research project, allowing for the simple
specification of a parser using a statically typed programming language whereby
the grammar rules could be seen as types. Separate concrete syntaxes cohering
with a given abstract syntax allowed for language-specific parsing, sugaring,
and translation. The GF ``standard library'', the Resource Grammar Library (RGL)
\cite{ranta2009rgl}, allows one to get off-the-shelf grammatical constructions
for more than 30 languages, with English being the most comprehensively covered. The RGL
therefore allows the grammar writer to focus on the semantic domain of the
application the grammar is being developed for. In addition to this, one can
embed a grammar as a Generalized Algebraic Datatype (GADT) in Haskell via the
Portable Grammar Format (PGF) \cite{angelov2010pgf}. One can get run-time
support for parsing and linearization directly in Haskell, in addition to
manipulating the trees by pattern matching over them as Haskell programs.

A reflection on these historical developments reveals that GF is intimately tied
to both the formal/informal distinction in addition to the syntactical and
semantical approaches present in computational linguistics. These dual characteristics
very much inform our problem as well. In the context of designing a voice
assistant for, whereby one can give commands like ``turn
right after the woman with the big dog'', we desire that the intensional belief a
user has about her utterance is consistent with the extensional behavior of the
vehicle. This can be done through an intermediary mapping to a formal semantic
representation. Ensuring that the syntactic content of a speaker's
(well-formed) utterance maps predictably to the logical form is important from
the verificationist perspective : one wants to maximize the \emph{syntactic
completeness} of the system \cite{macmillan2021}.

In a dual situation we briefly mention, one can imagine our voice assistant as
giving the user feedback, responding with clarifications (``we will turn after
the big cafe even though the other route may have less traffic''), questions
(``do you mean this or that person?''), or even possible illocutionary
directives (``we won't drive over the speed limit in a school zone''), requiring
the computer to generate an utterance after it has made some internal
determination. This internal deliberation must be a program, possibly expressed
inside or outside our semantical space. It should be capable of identifying
multiple routes in the clarification, multiple objects in a given state in the
question regarding two people, or constraints based off external circumstances
such as speed limits in school zones. In each case, the formation of a natural
language utterance requires the computer to generate natural language which must
conform to both a program's structure and behavior, but which also may be clear
and recognizable to the user.

Independently of \emph{how} the robot determines a program whose meaning it
needs to convey to a user, the property of providing a natural language
utterance which fluently conveys meaning in a natural language to some native
speaker is called \emph{semantic adequacy} \cite{macmillan2021}. Determining a
reasonable syntax and semantics for a controlled natural language should most
certainly conform to the dual standards of syntactic completeness and semantic
adequacy, if the voice assistant is to be held to any kind of regulatable
standard.

\subsection{Semantical Representations}

We choose LTL as our semantic form in large part due to its relative
expressivity for the kinds of verification conditions one might anticipate an
autonomous vehicle needing to carry out, in addition to its ubiquitous
appearance in the existing literature. Nonetheless, it is obvious their are many
types of logical conditions LTL doesn't immediately support, and other logics,
particularly ones which allow one to reason about space in its relation to time,
would be an ideal direction to look. This line of research is probably more
suited to people developing systems at later stages of development, where
empirical observations may be collected in the wild. The nuances of where an
autonomous navigator responding to a human agent can go wrong, and the most
amenable set of verification conditions to prevent this, will ultimately have to
be gained through trial and error.

\subsubsection{Notions of Semantics}

We also note that the notion ``semantics'', having many connotations and interpretations in
different fields, is subject to many interpretations. Here are some examples :

\begin{itemize}

\item In linguistics, semantics may be interpreted as intended meaning.
Different theoretical notions of meaning may include a logical meaning, as in
the case of Montague semantics, or a meaning as it arises in the use and context
of culture, as is the case of cognitive semantics.
\item In programming languages, the semantics of a syntactic entity most
commonly means the mathematical behavior (denotational semantics) or behavior
during execution (operational semantics).
\item In statistical notions of semantics, one often seeks the ability of one to
capture meaning via language use, most common in contemporary contexts, its
practical uses. Frequently Word2Vec \cite{word2vec} is referenced in this context,
although the advent of transformers in recent years has largely usurped this. 
\end{itemize}

The problem presented in our work, of speaking to a machine, presents challenges
in that it requires notions of semantics from disparate disciplines, which
themselves have little overlap (at least as treated in the existing literature).
This is because we are attempting to witness an utterance as a natural, native
linguistic phenomena with an indented speaker meaning, a program whose syntax is
defined via the CNL, and a statistical observation defined over some probability
distribution of ``sayable things''. More concretely we ask :

\begin{itemize}
\item How is the speakers meaning interpreted as if intended to be understood by
  other native speakers?
\item How does the speakers meaning manifest as a formal program a computer can
  evaluate?
\item How can we identify a speakers meaning in a possibly infinite space of
  utterances and contexts in which those utterances arise, neither of which can
  be formally defined \emph{a priori}?
\end{itemize}

Although the inter-relatedness of various semantic theories is a much bigger
project than we can give space to here, it should be granted that problem we
address forces one, both implicitly and explicitly, to try to grapple with them.
We chose \emph{the syntax of LTL} as the \emph{semantics of our CNL} which is
defined by filtering a ``naturally observed'' corpus to a primitive grammar. We
propose to fit unseen utterances by fine-tuning a transformer-based language
model to the corpus and grammar. We can then seek specific formalisms in which
to analyze our problem domain :

\begin{itemize}
\item The meaning for a passenger-speaker can be analyzed in a variety of ways :
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The meaning of an utterance is a logical formula following Montague's
    lead, substituting temporal operators for generalized quantifiers.
    \item That the passenger's utterance should be determined as a speech act
      which carries illocutionary force and intention. The computer's
      response can be seen as conforming to or negotiating with the desires of
      the user, subject to the computers internal constraints and possible
      contextual information about which user may be unaware. Applying speech
      act theory in the context of human computer interaction has a long history
      \cite{winograd}.
  \end{itemize}
% from wikipedia
% The key insight provided by Winograd and Flores is that the state-transition diagram representing the social (Illocutionary) negotiation of the two parties involved is generally much, much simpler than any model representing the world in which those parties are making claims; in short, the system tracking the status of the conversation for action need not be concerned with modeling all of the realities of the external world
\item The meaning of the syntactic formula, can be interpreted in many possible ways
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A type specification. In a case where
      temporal logic formulas are interpreted as types, Functional Reactive
      Programming (FRP), provides a functional programming context with which to
      interpret temporal formulas
      \cite{hudak}.
    \item A (possibly verifiable) motion planner  \cite{verifiedMotion} \cite{7759412} \cite{kuo2020deep}
    \item A dialogue state, in the envisioned Question Answer (QA) context, whereby
      the computer must provide feedback to the user based of contextual information
  \end{itemize}
\item The meaning from the mostly unseen utterances is given a canonical form,
  and the canonicalization process is a transformation via the vector-space and
  distributional notions of meaning implicit in an attention-based neural network 
\end{itemize}

We don't intend to exhaust the list of possibilities here, neither in our
description of the many meanings of ``semantics'', nor in how our taxonomy of
semantics can be understood in the context of our solution to the problem of
giving navigation commands to a autonomous driver. We intend to clarify some of
the many subtleties and terminological confusions arising from many
communities of researchers. We suggest that working towards a unified view of
what kinds of semantic notions we want to deal in this particular domain may
inform better solutions to the problem at hand.

\subsection{Robot Motion and Natural Language}

The challenge of designing a system which generates robot control strategies
from human language has to balance the expressiveness of task specification,
complexity of environment, and provable correctness \cite{4141034}. In this
context, we assume that expressivity of the language itself should reflect the
complexity of the environments, thereby being adequately descriptive. The
criteria of correctness : that the language itself is well-represented in the
LTL semantics - the system being is syntactically complete - is the focus of
these investigations. Our work additionally, is the only work we know of which
actually seeks autonomous vehicles as the central motivation, rather than more
general robotics applications.

\subsubsection{Semantic Parsing}

The problem of semantic parsing consists of mapping natural language utterances
not just to syntactic trees, but to semantic ones. A sub-field of Natural
Language Understanding (NLU), building automated systems for mapping syntax to
semantic forms can be traced back to Winograd's SHRDLU
\cite{winograd1971procedures}. Although seen as a success at the time, SHRDLU
was also incredibly brittle, and apparently led Winograd to step away from NLU,
believing the problem too difficult.

The largest strain of contemporary interest in semantic parsers emerged during
the resurgence applying deep neural networks to a variety of problems in NLP.
An important observation, to view ``semantic parsing as paraphrasing''
\cite{berant-liang-2014-semantic}, has greatly influenced the contemporary
statistical approaches to semantic parsing. Much of this work has still used
grammars as a central component in their  pipeline, often to generate sentences
randomly for the construction of a corpus to train with.

Towards the extreme of the data-centered perspective, it has been advocated to
get rid of the parser in semantic parsers altogether. In \cite{dontParse}, the
authors naively takes for granted large public data-sets with syntactic and
semantic forms, neither of which exist for autonomous vehicle syntax and
temporal logic semantic formalism. Our approach takes for granted that the
parser is one of the most controllable and easily understood components of a NL
pipeline.

\subsubsection{Temporal Logic for Robot Verification}

\begin{quote}
Overall, the typical approach followed by these studies can be summarized as follows:
given an input English utterance, preprocess it to extract syntactical information, which may
include part of speech tagging, dependency parsing, semantic role labelling, and so on. Then,
enrich the input with these pieces of information. Finally, run an attribute grammar-based
parser, or rely on some hand-made rules, to derive a translation into a target logical format.
\cite{brunello_et_al}
\end{quote}

Brunello et al. give a thorough literature review of the many ways of
translating natural language to LTL, indicating the interest and need of
suitable semantic parsers in this domain. We give a refined perspective on the
problems below, deferring a formal treatment of LTL to the appendix [TODO :
reference].

We need a comprehensive view of the robot control problem as it pertains to
temporal logics. Our considerations should include :

\begin{itemize}
\item The kinds of logical behavior one may wish to capture
\item The sorts of missions we want our autonomous agent to accomplish
\item The types of atomic grounded conditions one may want to include
\item How do we model both the vehicle and the environment
\item How do these logical behaviors interface with other components of the
  larger system
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Temporal Logics}

As regards the logical behavior, there are an array of logics available.

\begin{itemize}
\item Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\item
\end{itemize}
\item Metric Temporal Logic (MTL)

  modal operators can express timing constraints
\item Signal Temporal Logic (STL)

  can be appended with a metric semantics, to show how well a formula satisfies
\item Computation Tree Logic (CTL)
  follow the car in front of us 
\item CTL*
\item Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) 
  go to the store if its unlikely we'll hit bad traffic
\end{itemize}

% Co-safe LTL (non-reactive): (¬Deliver ) U(Deliver ∧(Office B ∨Office C )) expresses “deliver
% a package to one of offices B or C but not anywhere else” .
% GR(1) fragment (reactive):  
%  (SensePackage → (Deliver ∧ (Office B ∨ OfficeC ))) ∧

% wise semantics over finite words are decidable but non-primitive recursive. Over
% infinite words, both problems are undecidable.

%  Model checking and satisfiability for MTL in the continuous
% semantics (over both finite and infinite signals) are undecidable.

\paragraph{Missions Types}

In the literature, there are two main properties of concern
when specifying robot behaviors to be checked by models : \emph{safety} and \emph{liveness}.
These are intimately related to the temporal modalities. Safety
properties say ``nothing bad ever happens'', that is, a specification is
satisfied globally by some model. Liveness conditions, on the other hand, mean
that ``something good eventually happens''. An important theoretical result is
that safety and liveness are expressively adequate : every property of interest can be
decomposed into safety and liveness components \cite{Piterman2018}.

This distinction is particularly relevant for our analysis, because we suggest
that for the most part, directions given by a human (at least in our fragmented
treatment) should be interpreted as liveness conditions. The
expression of the desire to reach of a sequence of destinations, says that
eventually we arrive at each such destination.

On the other hand, when we account for behaviors of the vehicle that are
generally not intended to be instructed by the driver, these should be
interpreted as safety properties. Obeying all traffic laws can be treated as a
global condition that the neither passenger, nor an adversarial attacker should
be able to override. Additionally, ``comfort properties'', like assuring the
vehicle never accelerates too quickly or takes turns too quickly could also be
encoded in this way. While there may be other mechanisms of enforcing or
verifying that a vehicle meets these standards, we envision that the route
planner (and the verifier) should treat the linguistic utterance as saying that
do something good while simultaneously always never behaving badly.

We now discuss the missions that a user would want to instruct a vehicle to
carry out, in the context of satisfying a stack of safety property
preconditions. In \cite{specPat}, the authors empirically analyze an array of
literature about robots and the types of missions they are typically employed
for, filter out a subset of generalized LTL formulas which appear frequently,
and design a tool PsA1M capable of building template missions over these formulas.
We pay particular attention to what they call ``core movement patterns'', which
include coverage (mainly what we're concerned with) and surveillance (which
could be relevant, if, for instance, one wanted to design a autonomous-taxi that
surveils a region of interest for passengers).

The coverage properties consist of 

\paragraph{Grounding}



\paragraph{Environment and Vehicluar Modeling}
\paragraph{External }


% A property φ is a safety property for a set of models if for every model σ that
% violates φ, i.e., σ |= φ, there exists an i such that for every σ  that agrees with σ
% up to position i, i.e., ∀0 ≤ j ≤ i, σi  = σi , σ  also violates φ. As mentioned, safety
% properties specify bad things that should never happen. Thus, once an error has
% occurred (in location i), it is impossible to undo it. Every possible extension also
% includes the same error and is unsafe.
% A property φ is a liveness property for a set of models if for every prefix of a
% model w0 , . . . , wi there exists an infinite model σ that starts with w0, . . . , wi and
% σ |= φ. As mentioned liveness properties specify good things that should occur.
% Thus, regardless of the history of the computation, it is still possible to find an
% extension that will fulfill the specification.

% Theorem 2 Every language L ⊆ (2P )ω is expressible as the intersection Ls ∩ Ll ,
% where Ls is a safety property and Ll is a liveness property.

An interesting result published more recently attempts to translate between
English and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) \cite{he2021english}, which has the
advantage of not just treating Boolean, but real-valued signals. From this
perceptive, STL vs LTL can be understood as a quantitative versus qualitative
way of analyzing events. The fact that STL gives the specifications a higher
expressiveness in terms of how the order of events takes place, but also comes
with a higher computational cost [ref needed], but more importantly, a
potentially unnecessary complication for the system designer, The more
granularity view of time may be unnecessary in many cases - our data set doesn't
cover time at all (a defect, [reference below]), but even in a more naturally
derived corpus, might only crop up as an ``edge case'' relative to other more
important or likely phenomena that engineers may wish to capture.

We recognize that there are many degrees of freedom in the both the syntactic
and semantic formalisms chosen, as well as their evaluation or grounding within
physical environments. With respect to parsing, one could choose a categorial
grammar approach \cite{5152776}, or even forego using phrase-structure
formalisms and use dependency grammars - of which there has been recent work in
using dependency formalisms in conjunction with GF \cite{ranta2017cross}.
Additionally, many of our ideas should be applicable to robotics applications
outside of the autonomous vehicle space, although syntactic, semantic, and
data-specific nuances will have to be reconsidered for each domain.



Modal logics, specifically those dealing with stateful staging of events like
LTL \cite{ltl95}, Computation Tree Logic (CTL) \cite{yooCTL}, Signal Temporal
Logic (STL) \cite{stlAut} , have been used extensively in the specification and
verification of properties of robotics systems, including autonomous vehicles .
As LTL is often seen as one of the ``primitive'' temporal logic, we chose it as
a our semantic space despite its limitations (the lack of numerical precision,
predicates for spatial relations, etc). We appreciate that future work will need
to expand the scope of which logic (or possibly \emph{logics}) the machine may
use to verify behavior, in addition to the mathematical models most amenable to
verification of a logical formula.

% Additionally, LTL  formulas can be transformed into automata which can then be used as reward
% functions for reinforcement learners, as in \cite{ltlRein}.

\subsubsection{Natural Language and LTL verification}


Just as important as producing a
well-formed and meaningful LTL formula, but not explored in our work, is the
translation from a logical formula a trustworthy controller meant for navigating
a complex environment. For instance, in \cite{plaku2016motion} the authors
indicate how to actually ground basic propositions from language to paths in a
space, while our model, outputting formulas with non-grounded base predicates,
is merely concerned with logical structure.

Similarly, in \cite{7759412}, the authors develop a Verifiable Distributed
Correspondence Graph (V-DCG) model whereby LTL formulas are used to ensure
grounded instruction sequences are consistent. This work builds on other work of
Kress-Gazit et al. \cite{provCorrectNatControl}, whereby the The Situated
Language Understanding Robot Platform (SLURP) allows translation of arbitrary
natural language into LTL. They suggest an ``ontology of common actions and the
type of formulas that they produce'' is of critical importance. Our work is
directly focused on the \emph{centrality of the grammar}, where a GF abstract
syntax design allows one to give a precise ontology. We therefore see our work as
a key intermediary phase when balancing formal and empirical interests.
Kress-Gazit's work is more concerned with the controllers generated as the end
result of a pipeline where the intermediary grammatical structure may not be so
relevant.

Our GF implementation, seeing the grammar as a necessary part of the
verifiability (in that we can systematically map our sequences of commands to
logical formulas representing sequences of states), also makes the possibility of
supporting multi-lingual verifiability more immediate. Our system does not
support this currently, but can easily be adjusted to so with the help of GF's
functors (roughly adapted from Standard ML's functors) and the RGL. The lack of wide-coverage
support of our grammar is possible to remediate through possible fine-tuning of
a large language model to a data-set which coheres to the language our GF
grammar generates, and we detail this in our discussion below [TODO : link].

Another approach seeks to train a natural language to LTL planner using both NNs
and reinforcement learning \cite{ltlSemParse}. Their work also uses a
simultaneous CFG to generate \emph{semantically inadequate} sentences with
corresponding LTL formulas from which they can direct machines to follow the
instructions, and then have users describe the robot behavior in a more natural
form. Despite this, their approach uses the machine to generate sentences and
corresponding situations, most of which are ``nonsense'' and need to be filtered
out, thereby leaving the narrations upon which their system leaves devoid of a
genuine empirical data source. In addition, their corpus only contains 266
words, still not the size one would need for our system. Finally, our suggested
use of a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to the semantic parsing task
gives us more flexibility in that the neural network and the verifiable grammar
and semantics in the kernel could allow us to focus on the problems of breadth
and depth somewhat independently.

The same group, in \cite{kuo2020deep}, explore the most general possible
end-to-end utterance to planner pipeline without intermediary states, namely, a
symbolic representation. While this ``cutting out the middle woman'' mentality
may be an idealistic long-term vision, it makes the system much too much of a
black box - even though they are able to reason about their system's behavior
through the use of attention maps. For the fine-tuned verification conditions
about the linguistic utterances our work explores, the intermediate symbolic
representations give a more explainable, predictable, and regulatable system.


Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (Fret) {fret}

Use in aircraft, where there are many more controls, and the types of
descriptions are inherently much more ``structured'', i.e. the pilots are
assumed to have expertise and aren't just taking ad-hoc flights, but perhaps
still don't have engineering, verification, or logical knowledge to give precise
LTL specifications

In \cite{fret} they use the Prototype Verification System (PVS) theorem prover
to verify that

amenable to formal analysis: (1) associating requirements with formulas that can
be processed by analysis tools and (2) ensuring that the formulas conform to the
language semantics. \cite{fretish}

\subsubsection{Tellex}

Stephanie Tellex has written extensively about natural language inputs and
interfaces with robots. Although she has not specifically written about
autonomous vehicles, the domains have enough intersection to warrant careful
consideration of much of her work, especially the recent stuff.

\begin{itemize}

\item Grounding with an intermediate symbolic state, no LTL, but possibly
  relevant for paper generally. She also cites \cite{walkTalk}, a seminal paper in this area
\begin{quote}
Instruction following is a supervised learning problem
where the agent must predict a trajectory that would satisfy an
input natural language command. \cite{tellexInstr}
\end{quote}
\item The review paper \cite{MARGE2022101255} making recommendations has a
  section on robustness, but this is mostly for the sake of allowing sharing of
  interfaces and efficacy, no mention of verification (which is what we're
  primarily after)
\item They design a NL -> LTL for drones that are grounded to actual landmarks \cite{9197068}
\item The group builds a trained pipeline that uses an object oriented
  template-instance methodology to generalize to different ontological
  categories in  \cite{hsiung2021generalizing} [under review]

\item In \cite{patellearning} build learn a semantic parser from NL to LTL (so
that the language is grounded) where they collect executions of the LTL formulas
in different environments using a weakly-supervised training method with
reinforcement learning Part if the paper has to do with the execution of the
command being dependent on the path taken by the robot executing the command,
not just meeting the goal requirements, thereby giving a complexity bonus in
comparison to previous work. She also evaluates the model on the \cite{walkTalk}
data set

\subsection{Statistical (pre-trained) Language Models}


\begin{itemize}

\item In \cite{fewShotSem} [under review], the authors show how, using a \emph{synchronous
context-free grammar} (SCFG) to define a minified CNL with a parallel and dually
parsible semantic form, that one can use a large pre-trained language model as a front-end
to filter a much wider syntax into the CNL. GF's expressivity is
more expressive than the SCFG, at least based off a tertiary reading in the
index, and therefore if we carved out a subset of commands to cohere with our
LTL,

our model would be amenable to a similar

\item  \cite{hauser2021bert} [under review] claims that Bert is robust, analyzing claims of four
  papers, including the one which uses a wordnet attack

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Voice assistants for autonomous vehicles}

The public company Cerence \cite{} is already designing voice assistants for autonomous
vehicles, for which it has a large software stack between the voice processing
to actual control of current automative components. In addition to its 
technologies, many of which aren't accessible to external researchers due to
intellectual property restrictions, Cerence has contracts with large automakers
[..]. It is therefore natural to inquire, what a small team with varied
backgrounds and not nearly the same expertise nor experience within the
technological team at Cerence can provide.

First, we believe that the focus on verification, insofar as we envision it, is
unlikely to be of current concern at Cerence due to the fact that their products
are still being developed, and the primary goal of producing a working product
is likely to precedence over preventing non-existent hostile actors.

Additionally, it is going to have to be determined by 
[verification of self-driving cars generally : software, hardware, behavior in
a real environment, etc]



\section{Future Work}

The ``sets of'' clause
references the inevitable ambiguity of parses even from a big enough parser, even
if the size of the canoncial expressions is vastly smaller than the domain of
expressions mapping to them.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{pics/one.jpg}
\caption{Language and Logical Spaces of Concern} \label{fig:M1}
\end{figure}

We begin in \autoref{fig:M1} with a high level overview of this semantic parsing
system, whereby the space of natural language syntax can be mapped to some
formal language semantic space (and possibly have some kind of inverse mapping).
We note that ``Natural Language'', while an idealized notion, can be thought of
the space of interpretable utterances. The relatively small subset of these
utterances which one might give to a robot, labeled ``Robot Control Language'',
is the ideal breadth our system would support, is still actually very large. We
therefore applying another filter, to the ``Canonical Command Language'' which
is inductively defined via some relatively thin set of grammar rules, which
simultaneously generate and parse expressions in some logic. Although we target
LTL because of its prominence in the literature and relatively straightforward
implementation and interpretation, it should be noted that their are other
temporal logics which may well be more expressive and better suited to the
actual problem of synthesizing controllers.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{pics/two.jpg}
\caption{Transformer to Robot Control Language}\label{fig:M2}
\end{figure}

Due to the recent influx of transformer based language models like Bert and
GPT-3, we take for granted that the easiest way to target our ``Robot Control
Language'' will be through fine-tuning one of these models, as shown in
\autoref{fig:M2}. These transformers, trained on a separate corpus like
Wikepdia, can be mapped to some suitable set of robot commands, even though
these types of expressions will have a sparse presence in the corpus the model
was initially trained on (presumably Marco will know more about this than me).

In this context, we can then further refine the language to something less
natural, but more well-behaved. The whole proposed pipeline in \autoref{fig:M3},
indicates using the methodology as used in \cite{fewShotSem}, whereby the
semantic parser should ideally be able to take any command from the Robot
Control Language and turn it into a set of temporal logic formulas, distributed
according to most likely interpretation.

Ideally, the downstream dialogue system should either be able to ask for
clarification if two formulas are determined to be of some relative likelihood,
reject a formula that is not determined to be achievable (for whatever reason),
or synthesize a sequence of actions (and express those in the CNL) according to
the possibly modified current path.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{pics/three.jpg}
\caption{Pipeline from NL to LTL}\label{fig:M3}
\end{figure}

In theory, we can embed clauses which in turn reflect all of natural language :
``Stop at the man who is watching the tv show on his phone about time traveler
who goes back to the 12th century Mongolia, whereby the man, not speaking
Mongolian ...'' This is clearly outside the boundary of what the robot control
language should support, and ideally would be accepted or rejected by the
computer prior to the commands completion depending if there was a man looking
at a phone. Our parser currently accepts strings in our primitive canonical
language, designed in Grammatical Framework (GF), such as :

\begin{verbatim}
  p "drive to the store , turn right and stop at the dog"

  MultipleRoutes And (ConsPosCommand (SimpleCom (ModAction Drive (MkAdvPh To
  (WhichObject The Store)))) (BasePosCommand (SimpleCom (ModAction Turn
  (WherePhrase Right))) (SimpleCom (ModAction Stop (MkAdvPh At (WhichObject The
  Dog))))))
\end{verbatim}

However, we may envision our system being able to accept an expression in the
Robot Control Language like ``hit the petal till we reach the store, hang a
right, and halt when you see a cute little puppy''. We could certainly adjust
our parser to accomodate this, but it would be one of many possible edge cases
unlikely to be uttered. To accomodate many more such edge cases would cause an
exponential blowup in the parser size (thereby slowing down parsing), but more
importantly, cause the programmer a headache in building the parser, and then
mapping the NL ASTs to a LTL form. If we treat $F$ as the operating
expressing the existence a future state, $X$ as the next state, and $G$ meaning
the universal future, our desired LTL formula would most likely treat this as
$F\ (store \land\ (X\ turn\_right\ \land\ (F\ (G\ dog))))$, although we propose
that the actual grounding of these to images or controllable actions to some
downstream system.

LTL has been a popular logic for specifying controllable robot behaviors,
particularly with respect to verification of their behaviors. In
\cite{verifiedMotion}, Rizaldi et al. prove logical correctness of a motion
planner with respect to LTL formulas over maneuver automata formulas in the
Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, a non-dependent cousin of Agda.

They adopt a
modified semantics to \cite{fainekos2005temporal}, where they consider multiple
paths instead of one. They use a model checker to generate the plan

We are choosing to
deeply embed LTL in Agda for a few reasons, although the syntax of the embedding
could easily be translated to any other dependently typed theorem prover, and
with a little more effort probably any functional programming language. The
composition of a ``weakly verified'' natural language front-end with a formally
verified back-end such as in Rizaldi's work would pave the way for a fully
verified, utterance-to-vehicle-path pipeline for the autonomous vehicles.

The big question to address is what kind of verification conditions the natural
language component should be subjected to, and what kind of attacks would be
most important to preemptively anticipate. Substitution based attacks
\cite{substAttacks}, for instance, have been consistently emphasized throughout
our discussions so far. The question is, \emph{where} in the pipeline it would
be best to filter out the vulnerabilities, as well as \emph{how}.

One possibility would be to define words modulo equivalent meanings using
Wordnet \cite{wordnet} in the syntactic phase, either via training
\cite{ren-etal-2019-generating} (presumably during the fine-tuning to the Robot
Command Language or our ``canonicalization'' from that). It has been suggested
that Bert is already relatively robust against such attacks
\cite{hauser2021bert}, but we nonetheless feel that even higher sensitivities of
robustness may be better done at other phases in the pipeline.

Alternatively, one could just map these equivalent Wordnet forms to equivalent
parse trees using the Portable Grammar Format (PGF) Haskell library, which
essentially deeply embeds a GF grammar into a Generalized Algebraic Datatype
(GADT).

For instance, if we abstract over all abstract syntax trees for our grammar
using this library, we can define the following Haskell functions to equate a
``female human'' with a ``woman''. 

\begin{verbatim}
treeMapfemalePersonIsWoman :: forall a. Tree a -> Tree a
treeMapfemalePersonIsWoman (GModObj GFemale GPerson) = GWoman
treeMapfemalePersonIsWoman GWoman                    = (GModObj GFemale GPerson)
treeMapfemalePersonIsWoman gp = composOp treeMapfemalePersonIsWoman gp
\end{verbatim}

There has been work integrating multiple language Wordnets with GF
\cite{virk2014developing}, so it would presumably be easy to integrate with our
system, depending on how large we want the grammar to get.


As it is unclear what the best direction for this is, and how the attacker model
in the context of an autonomous vehicle might work, all these decisions need to
be made in the context of discussions within the group.

[ Addendum before meeting : ]

The TOUCHDOWN data set \cite{chen2019touchdown} seems like the most
comprehensive and relevant data we'll find to fine-tune via one of these
pre-trained models. Please see https://github.com/lil-lab/touchdown


The idea of domain specific pre-training can be traced to
\cite{gururangan-etal-2020-dont}, where the authors introduce the concepts of
\emph{domain-adpative pretraining} and \emph{task-adpative pretraining}, whereby
this additional pre-training phase greatly improves efficacy of the LM on
corpus and task data not well represented in the training data.

The language models have been show \cite{bioBert}

\subsection{Data Set}

The most comprehensive data set known to us is the TOUCHDOWN data set
\cite{chen2019touchdown}, which can simultaneously serve as a data source to
inform the actual grammar (ideally, we'd like to be able to generate a grammar
from a data source)

authors use ``interactive visual navigation environment based on Google Street
View''

position of the agent relative to an object, and the position of two objects
relative to one another
``resolving the spatial descriptions'', but we focus only on the navigation part
of the task

Positive

\begin{itemize}
\item Real-world observations
\item Real descriptions of these observations
\item Diverse, relatively large
\item
\end{itemize}

Follows ``instruction writing, target propagation to panoramas, validation, and
workers and qualification'', the validation here 

That having the data grounded is both incredibly beneficial, but also makes
designing the syntax and semantics tricky.

\begin{itemize}
\item Finding the touchdown only coarsely approximates general navigating in a city.
\item The workers
  aren't in a place they know, so everything the reference is in their immediate
  visual environment
\item and this is a ``short-term'' task, it requires no long-distance navigation
  and reasoning 
\item Limited to NYC, hectic urban environments (also, daytime)
\item Working with panoramas is not necessarily a great simulation to a real environment
\item ``They are not per- mitted to write instructions that refer to text in the
images, including street names, store names, or numbers''
\item No temporal reasoning (as spatio-temporal is assumed)
\end{itemize}

Ideally our data set would then have the properties

\begin{itemize}
\item Long and short-term tasks
\item Different cities, different languages (this will be dependent on the
  context of the data collected), for instance, where there are dirt roads
\item Updates over time (the user can update a context locally or globally) on
  the road
\item Users with various degrees of contextual information
  Contextual information
  - street place, names (named entity recognition) accessible to google
  - people's names (mom's house)
\end{itemize}

That the data collection task in an objective way is inherently tied to the way we approximate it in
collecting data, thereby limited by our experimental apparatus and assumptions
in designing the data set.

What is the actual feasibility of this stuff?

how well does a given logic allow us to reason about a space of instructions.
What is the logic grounded to, how it is verified , all of these may effect the
choice of formulas

we can't just design a perfect language to capture our meaning - goes back to
the wishful thinking of Frege, but we can try to approximate it

next intersection (and next left?) versus next gas station versus ``next to''
 will be a store on your left with stars next to the name.

there is could either be 
``all of the apartment buildings on your left''

if you are going the correct way.
logical content
You will know you're on the correct road if to your left there are planters in the middle of the street


\subsection{Syntax and Semantics}

When designing a grammar, we can pretend that initially

san abstract syntax, we have the following considerations

That when we are conditioning our syntacitc model of emperical, noisy, and
biased natural language data, so as to ideally generalize to unencountered
phenomena.

A central insight ambiguity : 


\begin{itemize}
\item Ontological semantic space. What are we trying to represent?
\item Intended semantic space, the logical or formal system which our grammar
  will map to (via Haskell transformations)
\item  We want to account for some grammatical constructions via the abstract syntax, but
  outsource most of the grammaticality to the RGL
\item Data source. How to conform to the data set in a way that's faithful but
  doesn't overfit (the overfitting can probably result in generating functions
  which are useless and either make our parser slow down or overgenerate)
\end{itemize}

While theres no clear way of relating the trade-offs, we can come up with some
heuristics that shed light. Developing the ``ontological design'' allows one to
capture the intuitive problem.


\subsection{Ambiguity}

What happens when we encounter ambiguity? For instance, in p "go to the person
with the dog ." The prepositional phrase "with the dog" can either modify person
(as an adjectival clause) or it can modify go (as an adverbial clause). Because
the parser is designed to accommodate simple cases of both types of clauses,
these ambiguities, even in simple sentences from our corpus, will grow quickly. 

In the case of a vehicle, however, knowing the correct parse is dependent on
the context in which the driver is going to the person : is the language
grounded in the fact that there a dog in the car, or a person in the purview
with a dog (or, most confusingly, perhaps both conditions are met, in which case
more contextual information is required to disambiguate the correct parse).

For we can actually program the semantics to accommodate both scenarios, whereby

$F (manwithdog /\ G Finish)$
$F (man /\ G Finish) /\ G withdog$

We can define our semantics to accommodate both interpretations, whereby the
parses produce unique semantic conditions, and the LTL solver will have to see
which condition is more easily satisfied. While this edge case may seem overly
pedantic to consider, as one's intuition might suggest the first case to be
overwhelmingly more natural, the


\section{Alternative ideas}

While the evaluation of machine learning systems provides assurances using
different scores and metrics on different tasks assures one they may on average
perform better than humans at certain tasks, the advent of adversarial attacks
\cite{szegedy} with the intention of deceiving such a system by a hostile actor
leads the system designer to desire, and possible require additional
verification about the system's behavior. In the context of natural language
processing (NLP), where data sources rely on strings of text, these attacks can
focus an array of features from spellings of individual words to rearranging
entire sentences \cite{}. So-called synonym attacks, which adversarially target
the system at the lexical level, can cause traditional NLP models to [...]
\cite{}.


Aside from the user experience being compromised by a system which has been
adversarially afflicted, there is also a possibility of physical danger for the
passenger and other people in the vicinity. As voice directed robots have many
possible points of failure, we focus on two types of verification for our
system. Rather than focus on breadth of language coverage, which ML language
models excel at of due to their reliance on statistical modeling and tons
of data, our system is narrowly focused as a proof-of-concept, from which it
could either be extended by hand, or different components modified using
other techniques and tools.
