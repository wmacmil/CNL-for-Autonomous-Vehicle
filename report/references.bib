abstract = {We address the problem of automatically synthesizing digital designs from linear-time specifications. We consider various classes of specifications that can be synthesized with effort quadratic in the number of states of the reactive system, where we measure effort in symbolic steps. The synthesis algorithm is based on a novel type of game called General Reactivity of rank 1 (gr(1)), with a winning condition of the form(□ ◊p1∧⋯∧□ ◊pm)→(□ ◊q1∧⋯∧□ ◊qn), where each pi and qi is a Boolean combination of atomic propositions. We show symbolic algorithms to solve this game, to build a winning strategy and several ways to optimize the winning strategy and to extract a system from it. We also show how to use gr(1) games to solve the synthesis of ltl specifications in many interesting cases. As empirical evidence to the generality and efficiency of our approach we include a significant case study. We describe the formal specifications and the synthesis process applied to a bus arbiter, which is a realistic industrial hardware specification of modest size.}

abstract="Temporal logic has been used by philosophers to reason about the way the world changes over time. Its modern use in specification and verification of systems describes the evolution of states of a program/design giving rise to descriptions of executions. Temporal logics can be classified by their view of the evolution of time as either linear or branching. In the linear-time view, we see time ranging over a linear total order and executions are sequences of states. When the system has multiple possible executions (due to nondeterminism or reading input) we view them as separate possible evolutions and the system has a set of possible behaviors. In the branching-time view, a point in time may have multiple possible successors and accordingly executions are tree-like structures. According to this view, a system has exactly one execution, which takes the form of a tree. We start this chapter by introducing Fair Discrete Structures, the model on which we evaluate the truth and falsity of temporal logic formulas. Fair Discrete Structures describe the states of a system and their possible evolution. We then proceed with the linear-time view and introduce Propositional Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We explain the distinction between safety and liveness properties and introduce a hierarchy of liveness properties of increasing expressiveness. We study the expressive power of full LTL and cover extensions that increase its expressive power. We introduce algorithms for checking the satisfiability of LTL and model checking LTL. We turn to the branching-time framework and introduce Computation Tree Logic (CTL). As before, we discuss its expressive power, consider extensions, and cover satisfiability and model checking. We then dedicate some time to examples of formulas in both LTL and CTL and stress the differences between the two. We end with a formal comparison of LTL and CTL and, in view of this comparison, introduce CTL*, a hybrid of LTL and CTL that combines the linear and branching views into one logic.",

    abstract = { Robot control for tasks such as moving around obstacles or grasping objects has advanced significantly in the last few decades. However, controlling robots to perform complex tasks is still accomplished largely by highly trained programmers in a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process that is typically validated only through extensive testing. Formal methods are mathematical techniques for reasoning about systems, their requirements, and their guarantees. Formal synthesis for robotics refers to frameworks for specifying tasks in a mathematically precise language and automatically transforming these specifications into correct-by-construction robot controllers or into a proof that the task cannot be done. Synthesis allows users to reason about the task specification rather than its implementation, reduces implementation error, and provides behavioral guarantees for the resulting controller. This article reviews the current state of formal synthesis for robotics and surveys the landscape of abstractions, specifications, and synthesis algorithms that enable it. }

abstract = {Structured natural languages provide a trade space between ambiguous natural languages that make up most written requirements, and mathematical formal specifications such as Linear Temporal Logic. FRETish is a structured natural language for the elicitation of system requirements developed at NASA. The related open-source tool Fret provides support for translating FRETish requirements into temporal logic formulas that can be input to several verification and analysis tools. In the context of safety-critical systems, it is crucial to ensure that a generated formula captures the semantics of the corresponding FRETish requirement precisely. This paper presents a rigorous formalization of the FRETish language including a new denotational semantics and a proof of semantic equivalence between FRETish specifications and their temporal logic counterparts computed by Fret. The complete formalization and the proof have been developed in the Prototype Verification System (PVS) theorem prover.},

abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling.An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

    abstract = "Semantic parsing is challenging due to the structure gap and the semantic gap between utterances and logical forms. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised semantic parsing method - Synchronous Semantic Decoding (SSD), which can simultaneously resolve the semantic gap and the structure gap by jointly leveraging paraphrasing and grammar-constrained decoding. Specifically, we reformulate semantic parsing as a constrained paraphrasing problem: given an utterance, our model synchronously generates its canonical utterancel and meaning representation. During synchronously decoding: the utterance paraphrasing is constrained by the structure of the logical form, therefore the canonical utterance can be paraphrased controlledly; the semantic decoding is guided by the semantics of the canonical utterance, therefore its logical form can be generated unsupervisedly. Experimental results show that SSD is a promising approach and can achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised semantic parsing performance on multiple datasets.",

Moreover, adapting to the task{'}s unlabeled data (task-adaptive pretraining) improves performance even after domain-adaptive pretraining. Finally, we show that adapting to a task corpus augmented using simple data selection strategies is an effective alternative, especially when resources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be unavailable. Overall, we consistently find that multi-phase adaptive pretraining offers large gains in task performance.",

The challenge of this task is to generate adversarial examples that maintain lexical correctness, grammatical correctness and semantic similarity. Based on the synonyms substitution strategy, we introduce a new word replacement order determined by both the word saliency and the classification probability, and propose a greedy algorithm called probability weighted word saliency (PWWS) for text adversarial attack. Experiments on three popular datasets using convolutional as well as LSTM models show that PWWS reduces the classification accuracy to the most extent, and keeps a very low word substitution rate. A human evaluation study shows that our generated adversarial examples maintain the semantic similarity well and are hard for humans to perceive. Performing adversarial training using our perturbed datasets improves the robustness of the models. At last, our method also exhibits a good transferability on the generated adversarial examples.",

abstract="Autonomous vehicles are safety-critical cyber-physical systems. To ensure their correctness, we use a proof assistant to prove safety properties deductively. This paper presents a formally verified motion planner based on manoeuvre automata in Isabelle/HOL. Two general properties which we ensure are numerical soundness (the absence of floating-point errors) and logical correctness (satisfying a plan specified in linear temporal logic). From these two properties, we obtain a motion planner whose correctness only depends on the validity of the models of the ego vehicle and its environment.",

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated system for generating, troubleshooting, and executing correct-by-construction controllers for autonomous robots using natural language input, allowing non-expert users to command robots to perform high-level tasks. This system unites the power of formal methods with the accessibility of natural language, providing controllers for implementable high-level task specifications, easy-to-understand feedback on those that cannot be achieved, and natural language explanation of the reason for the robot's actions during execution. The natural language system uses domain-general components that can easily be adapted to cover the vocabulary of new applications. Generation of a linear temporal logic specification from the user's natural language input uses a novel data structure that allows for subsequent mapping of logical propositions back to natural language, enabling natural language feedback about problems with the specification that are only identifiable in the logical form. We demonstrate the robustness of the natural language understanding system through a user study where participants interacted with a simulated robot in a search and rescue scenario. Automated analysis and user feedback on unimplementable specifications is demonstrated using an example involving a robot assistant in a hospital.},

In the image domain, these perturbations can often be made virtually indistinguishable to human perception, causing humans and state-of-the-art models to disagree. However, in the natural language domain, small perturbations are clearly perceptible, and the replacement of a single word can drastically alter the semantics of the document. Given these challenges, we use a black-box population-based optimization algorithm to generate semantically and syntactically similar adversarial examples that fool well-trained sentiment analysis and textual entailment models with success rates of 97{\%} and 70{\%}, respectively. We additionally demonstrate that 92.3{\%} of the successful sentiment analysis adversarial examples are classified to their original label by 20 human annotators, and that the examples are perceptibly quite similar. Finally, we discuss an attempt to use adversarial training as a defense, but fail to yield improvement, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our adversarial examples. We hope our findings encourage researchers to pursue improving the robustness of DNNs in the natural language domain.",
