General Considerations :

  - Proscriptive : what rules aren't allowed
  - Prescriptive : written from scratch

Problem type they are supposed to solve : 

  - C : improve communication among humans
  - T : improve translation or translatability
  - F : natural & intuitive for formal notations

Precision Expressiveness Naturalness Simplicity (PENS)

(i) Precision 

  -  P1 : imprecise
  -  p3 : mapping sentences to formal representation is not fully formal
        + think of this in the context of noise
  -  p5 : fixed semantics

(ii) Expressiveness
   
  -- given in paper
  (a) universal quantification over individuals (possibly limited)
  (b) relations of arity greater than 1 (e.g., binary relations)
  (c) general rule structures (ifâ€“then statements with multiple universal
      quantification that can target all argument positions of relations)
  (d) negation (strong negation or negation as failure)
  (e) general second-order universal quantification over concepts and relations

  - E1 : inexpressive 
  - E2 : description logics (still decidable)
  - E3 : FOL
  - E4 : HOL(2+)
  - E5 : Anything expressable

(iii) Naturalness

  - N1 : symbols, purely formal
  - N3 : Languages with dominant natural elements
  - N4 : Natural sentences
  - N5 : natural texts 

(iv) Simplicity : 

(verbatim)
  This description should not presuppose intuitive knowledge about any natural
  language. It is therefore not primarily a measure for the effort needed by a
  human to learn the language, neither does it capture the theoretical
  complexity of the language (as, for example, the Chomsky hierarchy does).
  Rather, it is closely related to the effort needed to fully implement the
  syntax and the semantics of the language in a mathematical model, such as a
  computer program.

criteria of exact and comprehensive

  - S1 : Very complex language
  - S2 : no exact nor comprehensive manner, but much simpler than S1
  - {natural}
  - S3 : >10 pages of rules
  - S4 : 1-10 pages of rules
  - S5 : <1 page of description
    {formal natural}

Examples 
English : p1 e5 n5 s1
Prop Logic : p5 e1 n1 s5

General "grading" criteria

C The goal is comprehensibility
T The goal is translation (**)
F The goal is formal representation (including automatic execution) (*)

W The language is intended to be written
S The language is intended to be spoken (*)
D The language is designed for a specific narrow domain (*)

A The language originated from academia (*)
I The language originated from industry 
G The language originated from a government 

(*) Definitely ours
(**) Possibly ours, or ideally

if we adjust local context, it may or may not effect the global context
