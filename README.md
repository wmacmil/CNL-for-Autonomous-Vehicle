# CNL-for-Autonomous-Vehicle

This repository is a collection of notes, ideas, and experimental implementations for the design of a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) for a hypothetical autonomous vehicle voice control system.


Note : GF allows for many morphological details to be brushed under the rug
(the semantics, singular or plural, of the determiner determins, the inflection
of the noun tree" - the same AST node Tree yields two different linearizations.

  "stop after these trees"
  DriveTo Stop After (ObjectPlace (WhichObject These Tree))

  p "stop after this tree"
  DriveTo Stop After (ObjectPlace (WhichObject This Tree))



"These" vs "those" have a spatial component
